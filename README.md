Reflection:
The industrial visit provided useful introduction of current technology used in industry. I discovered how Copilot creates images from commands of users and how to increase precision of instructions can enhance the output qualities. The technology open stall allowed me to explore variety of innovations at the technology open stall, which enhanced my understanding of how these technologies are applied in real world sceneries. Further talks can include more real-world case studies to show how tools like Copilot are used in actual industry projects. In summary, the visit made me be more aware to latest technologies and inspired me to learn more about technologies.
